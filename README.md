## Troubleshooting
* **Settings-Window has scaling issues**
    
    Check if the application has the permission to scale the window. This should only be a problem on linux.

* **Flickering DMX output**
    
    If the DMX output flickers, try to increase the break time. This can happen if the DMX-Interface is not able to handle the data rate.

    If multiple senders are sending data to the same universe, the data might interfere. Try to set the controller option to a specific sender.

* **Anything else?**

    Please open an issue if you encounter any other problems.
